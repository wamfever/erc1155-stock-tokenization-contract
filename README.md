# Stock Tokenzation with the help of ERC-1155

This is a sample project. With ❤, from Előd.

## General

### Purpose

Besides showcasing some really basic functionalities like transactions, multi-faced token creation with ERC-1155 and ungradability, ownership, the project serves as a "faucet" to create tokens for shares.

It is not expecting anything in return besides the gas prices and returns the tokens.

After creation the price, ticker and name attributes are constant, but there are
functionalities implemented to either retire or offer additional shares.
